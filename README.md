## Introduction to programming (C language) :computer:

This is the repository :file_folder: of the Introduction to programming course.

C is a very powerful programming language, in this language are developed low level applications, such as operating systems and algorithms. It is not recommended to develop high-level applications; But if you can embed C modules in them. It is an ideal language to start programming in structured mode: We will develop sequential programming, decision instructions, repetition, functions, arrays, strings, pointers and dynamic memory; We will also develop an application project of medium complexity.

If you ever have a suggestion or question, please [ask me](mailto://caznaranl@uni.pe) I will be glad to answer.
